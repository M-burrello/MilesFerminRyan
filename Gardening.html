        Keep tabs on your garden. Create a scrapbook using an inexpensive photo album and add your plant tags and sticks to it each season. 
        Then, make it as detailed as you'd like by adding information as to where the plants were purchased and where the plant was located in your garden. 
        Add your own artistic flair with sketches of your garden or photographs

  If this is your first year gardening, take it slow. Plant a few tomatoes and peppers. A small herb garden. Some beans and lettuce. Maybe some onions.
   Get used to how certain plants grow and their needs.
   Try out something like Square Foot Gardening to grow a lot of food in a smaller space.
